#Changelog

## 2.0.3
- overwrites changes in 2.0.2 (conflict not seen important enough to integrate back in)
- implement more translations (includes removing year 1 form controls and replacing with simple textboxes)
*note - currently only translates hardcoded parameter names and so not configured if user defined config*

## 2.0.2
- Failed implementationg of loading progress (userform retained in case attempt again in future)  
** It was determined that the time added to fuction calls was not worth the enhanced UI **
